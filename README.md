# Junior Developer Interview Prep

*Repository of things to assist Jr. developers with Interview Prep*

## Be Prepared to Whiteboard
You'll probably be given the opportunity to whiteboard a problem. The goal of this whiteboard session is not to see you write **perfect** code. Instead, it is designed to let a prospective employer see how you work out a problem. You should practice a scenario with a friend where someone asks you to solve a problem. These sorts of questions are very similar to word problems from gradeschool math.

#### Examples
- Can you draw an ERD diagram for the following SQL tables...?
- Can you write a logical statement for...?
- Can you manipulate an array/object using iteration...?
- Can you create a diagram that explains the purpose of MVC?
- Can you outline how to create an HTML Form to POST to...?
- Can you create a class (or constructor) for the following object...?
- Can you create an HTML template to render the following data...?

## Research the Company
If you're going to apply and then interview with a company, you should be familiar with what they sell/use. Research their Github; see what their developers use (if you can). If the company offers a service, create an account, login and try it out. Write down some questions about their product. Inspect their source code on the front end to see what libraries they may use. The more you know about the company when walking into the interview, the better!

#### Examples
- Github.com - In a `frameworks.js` file, they bundle/minify...
  - jQuery
  - Facebook for jQuery
  - Sizzle CSS Selector Engine
- GeneralAssemb.ly - uses...
  - jQuery
  - Facebook
  - Twitter
  - Google Analytics 

## Random Questions You May Be Asked

- What is the benefit of namespacing in a Javascript application?
- What is the next thing you'd like to learn?

- What is the purpose of a library like Backbone.js or Angular.js for Javascript?
- What is the primary difference between Sinatra and Ruby on Rails?
- Do you have any experience with using templates of any sort? If so, can you describe a use-case that you’ve used them for?

## The Joel Test
Read about the Joel Test. If you are unfamiliar with what some of these may be, check out the writeup below (as a Jr. developer I wouldn't expect you to understand all of these). If you're comfortable with one or two of these questions, it doesn't hurt to ask the interviewer one or two questions during the interview regarding these. Typically the Joel Test is designed to rate a company on how solid their development department is. 

- Do you use source control?
- Can you make a build in one step?
- Do you make daily builds?
- Do you have a bug database?
- Do you fix bugs before writing new code?
- Do you have an up-to-date schedule?
- Do you have a spec?
- Do programmers have quiet working conditions?
- Do you use the best tools money can buy?
- Do you have testers?
- Do new candidates write code during their interview?
- Do you do hallway usability testing?

## Final Thoughts
- Before interviewing, think of a 3-5 questions you'd like to ask the interviewer about the company/their product/wht you'll be doing.
- Ask what your role in the organization will be and what you can do to prepare for it prior to being hired. This also shows your interest in the role and your desire to **own** it.
- Ask what software/tools that the company uses; this lets you see what you'll be working with.
- Dress to impress... but ask what the expected dress code will be when scheduling the interview. Dress up one step nicer than that.
- Don't be afraid to say **I don't know**. It is better than lying. 
- If you need for clarification, ask! 
- Don't ask for specifics regarding benefits on the first interview.
- Get your interviewer's email address. Email them next day thanking them for their time. They'll remember you.
- Don't waste interview time with useless small talk.
- Talk to a friend before interviewing. You'll feel confident going in. It isn't a bad idea to walk to an interview with a friend.
- Your Github is your portfolio. Clean it up. Be proud of it. Remove bad code. 
- Demonstrate passion for what you are doing. It'll set you apart.
